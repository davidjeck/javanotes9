/**
 * This class is part of a demonstration of distributed computing.
 * It is to be used with CLMandelbrotTask.java on the worker computer.
 * CLMandelbrotWorker should be run as a command-line program on each
 * worker computer involved in the distributed computation.  When it is
 * running, it listens for a connection from the master computer.  The 
 * listening port number can be specified on the command line; if none is 
 * specified, a default port number is used.  It is possible to run several
 * copies of this program on the same computer, as long as they listen
 * on different ports.
 * 
 * After receiving a connection request from the master program, this
 * program expects to receive a sequence of tasks (of type CLMandelbrotTask)
 * from the master program.  It computes each task that it receives and
 * sends the results back to the master.  The process ends when this
 * program receives a CLOSE_CONNECTION_COMMAND from the master program.
 * It then goes back to listening for another connection.  (The connection
 * can also be terminated by a SHUT_DOWN_COMMAND.  When this command is 
 * received, this program shuts down.  However, this feature is not currently 
 * used.  Since graceful shutdown is not implemented, you can stop the
 * worker program using CONTROL-C.)
 * 
 * Note that data sent over the network is encoded as text.  The first
 * word on a line of text identifies the type of data.
