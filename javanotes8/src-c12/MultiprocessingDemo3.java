/**
 * This demo program divides up a large computation into a fairly
 * large number of smaller tasks.  The computation is to compute
 * an image, and each task computes one row of pixels in the image.
 * 
 * A thread pool is created at the beginning of the program, with
 * one thread for each available processor.  The threads remove
 * tasks from a blocking queue and execute them.  The threads never
 * terminate (until the program ends).  To start a computation, tasks
 * are created and added to the blocking queue.  As soon as the 
 * first tasks are added to the queue, the threads "wake up" and
 * start working on them.
 * 
 * (The image is a small piece of the famous Mandelbrot set,
 *  which is used just because it takes some time to compute.  
 * There is no need to understand what the image means.)
