/**
 * This abstract class represents a Client, or Player, that can connect
 * to a netgame Hub.  The client is used for sending messages to the
 * Hub (and through the Hub possibly to other clients).  It also 
 * receives messages from the Hub.  An application must define a
 * subclass of this abstract class in order to create players.
 * Each player in the game will have an associated Client object,
 * which will handle details of network communication with the Hub.
 * <p>At a minimum, the abstract method messageReceived(Object) must
 * be defined to say how the Client should respond when a message is
 * received.  Subclasses might also define the closedByError(),
 * serverShutdown(), playerConnected(), and playerDisconnected() methods.
 * <p>A client provides methods send(Object) and disconnect() for
 * sending a message to the Hub and for closing down the connection.
 * Any non-null object that implements the Serializable interface can be sent
 * as a message.  Note that an ObjectOutputStream is used for sending
 * messages.  If the same object is to be sent more than once, with
 * changes between transmissions, then the resetOutput() method should be
 * called between transmissions (or the autoreset property should be
 * set to true).
 * <p>A client has a unique ID number that is assigned to the client
 * when it connects to the hub.  The ID can retrieved by calling
 * the getID() method.  The protected variable connectedPlayerIDs
 * contains the ID numbers of all clients currently connected to the
 * hub, including this one.
