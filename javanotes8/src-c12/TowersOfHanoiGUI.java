/**
 *  This program shows an animation of the famous Towers of Hanoi problem, for a pile
 *  of ten disks.  Three control buttons allow the user to control the animation.
 *  A "Next" button allows the user to see just one move in the solution.  Clicking
 *  the "Run" button will let the animation run on its own; while it is running,
 *  "Run" changes to "Pause", and clicking the button will pause the animation.
 *  A "Start Again" button allows the user to restart the problem from the beginning.
 *  
 *  The program is an example of using the wait() and notify() methods.  The
 *  wait() method is used to pause the animation between moves.  When the user
 *  clicks "Next" or "Run", the notify() method is called to notify the thread to
 *  wake up and continue.  A "status" variable is used to communicate commands to
 *  the thread.
 *  
 *  A main() routine allows this class to be run as an application.
