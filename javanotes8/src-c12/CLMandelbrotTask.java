/**
 * This class is part of a demonstration of distributed computing.
 * It is to be used with CLMandelbrotWorker.java and CLMandelbrotMaster.java.
 * This class must be present on both the master computer (along with
 * CLMandelbrotMaster) and on the worker computers.
 * 
 * CLMandelbrotTask is a simple container that holds the data for one "task"
 * which consists of computing one row of data for a Mandelbrot image.  It
 * also contains the output of the task, and a method for doing the computation.
 * CLMandelbrotMaster computes the image by creating one CLMandelbrotTask for
 * each row in the image.  The tasks are sent over a network to CLMandelbrotWorkers
 * to be computed, and the results are returned to CLMandelbrotMaster where
 * all the results are combined to produce the entire image.
