<section id="overview.6" title="The Modern User Interface">

<p><start><big>W</big>hen computers were first introduced</start>, ordinary
people&mdash;including most programmers&mdash;couldn't get near them. They were
locked up in rooms with white-coated attendants who would take your programs
and data, feed them to the computer, and return the computer's response some
time later. When timesharing&mdash;where the computer switches its attention
rapidly from one person to another&mdash;was invented in the 1960s, it became
possible for several people to interact directly with the computer at the same
time. On a timesharing system, users sit at "terminals" where they type
commands to the computer, and the computer types back its response. Early
personal computers also used typed commands and responses, except that there
was only one person involved at a time. This type of interaction between a user
and a computer is called a <newword>command-line interface</newword>.</p>

<p>Today, of course, most people interact with computers in a completely
different way. They use a <newword>Graphical User Interface</newword>, 
or GUI. The computer draws interface <newword>components</newword> on the
screen. The components include things like windows, scroll bars, menus,
buttons, and icons. Usually, a <newword>mouse</newword> is used to
manipulate such components or, on "touchscreens," your fingers.
Assuming that you have not just been teleported in
from the 1970s, you are no doubt already familiar with the basics of graphical user
interfaces!</p>

<p>A lot of GUI interface components have become fairly standard. That is, they
have similar appearance and behavior on many different computer platforms
including Mac&nbsp;OS, Windows, and Linux. Java programs,
which are supposed to run on many different platforms without modification to
the program, can use all the standard GUI components. They might vary a little in
appearance from platform to platform, but their functionality should be
identical on any computer on which the program runs.</p>

<p>Shown below is an image of a very simple Java program that demonstrates
a few standard GUI interface components.  When the program is run, a window
similar to the picture shown here will open on the computer screen.
There are four components in the window with which the user can interact: 
a button, a checkbox, a text field, and
a pop-up menu. These components are labeled. There are a few other components
in the window. The labels themselves are components (even though you can't
interact with them). The right half of the window is a text area component,
which can display multiple lines of text. A&nbsp;scrollbar component appears
alongside the text area when the number of lines of text becomes larger
than will fit in the text area.  And in fact, in Java terminology, the
whole window is itself considered to be a "component."</p>

<np>(If you would like to run this program, the source code, <sourceref href="GUIDemo.java"/>,
is available on line.  For more information on using
this and other examples from this textbook, see <localref href="basics.6"/>.)</np>

<p>Now, Java actually has three complete sets of GUI components. One of these,
the AWT or <newword>Abstract Windowing Toolkit</newword>, was
available in the original version of Java. The second, which is known as
<newword>Swing</newword>, was introduced in Java version 1.2,
and was the standard GUI toolkit for many years.  The third GUI toolkit,
JavaFX, became a standard part of Java in Version&nbsp;8 (but 
but has recently been removed, so that it requires separate installation 
in some versions of Java).  Although
Swing, and even the AWT, can still be used, JavaFX is meant as a more modern
way to write GUI applications.  This textbook covers JavaFX exclusively.
(If you need to learn Swing, you can take a look at the previous version of this book.)
</p>

<p>When a user interacts with GUI components,
"events" are generated.  For example, clicking a push button generates an event, and pressing
a key on the keyboard generates an event.
Each time an
event is generated, a message is sent to the program telling it that the event
has occurred, and the program responds according to its program. In fact, a typical GUI
program consists largely of "event handlers" that tell the program how to respond
to various types of events. In the above example, the program has been programmed
to respond to each event by displaying a message in the text area.
In a more realistic example, the event handlers would have more to do.</p>

<p>The use of the term "message" here is deliberate. Messages, as you saw in
the <localref href="overview.5">previous&nbsp;section</localref>, are sent to objects. In fact, Java
GUI components are implemented as objects. Java includes many predefined
classes that represent various types of GUI components. Some of these classes
are subclasses of others. Here is a diagram showing just a few of the JavaFX GUI classes
and their relationships:</p>

<img width="605" height="272" src="overview-fig5.png" tex="overview-fig5.eps" texscale="0.7"/>

<p>Don't worry about the details for now, but try to get some feel about how
object-oriented programming and inheritance are used here. Note that all the
GUI classes shown here are subclasses, directly or indirectly, of a class called
<classname>Control</classname>, which represents general properties
that are shared by many JavaFX components. In the diagram,
two of the direct subclasses of <classname>Control</classname>
themselves have subclasses. The classes <classname>TextField</classname> and
<classname>TextArea</classname>, which have certain behaviors in common, are grouped
together as subclasses of <classname>TextInputControl</classname>.
Similarly <classname>Button</classname> and <classname>CheckBox</classname>
are subclasses of <classname>ButtonBase</classname>, which represents
properties common to both buttons and checkboxes.  (<classname>ComboBox</classname>,
by the way, is the class that represents pop-up menus.)
</p>

<p>Just from this brief discussion, perhaps you can see how GUI programming can
make effective use of object-oriented design. In fact, GUIs, with their
"visible objects," are probably a major factor contributing to the popularity
of OOP.</p>

<p>Programming with GUI components and events is one of the most interesting
aspects of Java. However, we will spend several chapters on the basics before
returning to this topic in <localref href="GUI1"/>.</p>
