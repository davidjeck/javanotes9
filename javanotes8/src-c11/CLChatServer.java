/**
 * This program is one end of a simple command-line interface chat program.
 * It acts as a server which waits for a connection from the CLChatClient 
 * program.  The port on which the server listens can be specified as a 
 * command-line argument.  If it is not, then the port specified by the
 * constant DEFAULT_PORT is used.  Note that if a port number of zero is 
 * specified, then the server will listen on any available port.
 * This program only supports one connection.  As soon as a connection is 
 * opened, the listening socket is closed down.  The two ends of the connection
 * each send a HANDSHAKE string to the other, so that both ends can verify
 * that the program on the other end is of the right type.  Then the connected 
 * programs alternate sending messages to each other.  The client always sends 
 * the first message.  The user on either end can close the connection by 
 * entering the string "quit" when prompted for a message.  Note that the first 
 * character of any string sent over the connection must be 0 or 1; this
 * character is interpreted as a command.
