<p><start><big>I</big>t's possible to program</start> a wide variety of GUI
applications using only the techniques covered in <localref href="GUI1"/>. In many
cases, the basic events, components, layouts, and graphics routines covered in
that chapter suffice. But the Swing graphical user interface library is far
richer than what we have seen so far, and it can be used to build highly
sophisticated applications. This chapter is a further introduction to Swing
and other aspects of GUI programming.
Although the title of the chapter is "Advanced GUI Programming," it is still
just an introduction. Full coverage of this topic would require at least another
complete book.</p>
