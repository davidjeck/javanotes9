<h2>News for <a href="index.html"><i>Introduction to Programming Using Java</i></a></h2>

<ul>
<li><b>May 16, 2018</b> -- I have posted Version 7.0.3, with just a very few corrections compared to
7.0.2.  This is the last update to the seventh edition, and I have begun work on the eighth edition.</li>
<li><b>November 25, 2017</b> -- My <a href="http://math.hws.edu/eck/cs124/index.html">CPSC 124 web site</a>
includes programming assignments as well as tests and quizzes from the current version of my Introductory
Programming course.  The <a href="http://math.hws.edu/eck/cs124/index_s17.html">Spring&nbsp;'17&nbsp;version</a>
is also available.</li><li><b>December 20, 2016</b> -- Version 7.0.2 is released, a minor upgrade from Version 7.0,
with a number of mostly typographical corrections beyond those in Version 7.0.1.  Thanks are due to readers who
emailed me with corrections, especially John Ganci, who is responsible for many of the corrections in this version.
I expect this to be the final release of the seventh edition of this book.  Substantive changes from Version 7.0
are noted below.   Older news can be found
below the list of errors.</li>
<li><b>December 16, 2016</b> -- I have just finished teaching an intermediate programming
course based on Chapters 8 through 13 of this book.  The web site,
<a href="http://math.hws.edu/eck/cs225/index_f16.html">http://math.hws.edu/eck/cs225/index_f16.html</a>,
includes a set of programming assignments that were used in the course.</li>
<li><b>March 19, 2016</b> -- I have added eBook versions of this textbook to the web site, in
"epub" format and in "mobi" format for Kindle.  They can be downloaded using links at the
bottom of the <a href="index.html">front&nbsp;page</a>.  Note that there can be problems with
the rendering of long lines in code samples, and that the problems will be worse on some
devices.  The eBook versions should be considered somewhat experimental.
In addition to adding the eBooks, a very small number
of errors (about a half dozen) have been fixed in the on-line and PDF versions, without
changing the version number.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Errata for Version 7.0.2</h2>

<p>This is a list of errors that have been found in Version 7.0.2.  Errors in this list have
been corrected in the on-line version, but not in the PDF or web site downloads or in the
printed version.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Section 1.3</b>, in the diagram, <span class="fix"><b>interpreter</b></span> was
misspelled as <span class="error"><b>interperter</b></span> in the three places where
it occurs in the diagram.</li>
<li><b>Section 3.6.1</b>, in the <b>if</b> statement that is supposed to be equivalent to the
case statement, the first two groups of statements that are listed as
<span class="error"><b>statements-2</b></span> and <span class="error"><b>statements-3</b></span>
should actually be <span class="fix"><b>statements-1</b></span> and <span class="fix"><b>statements-2</b></span>.</li>
<li><b>Section 10.3.1</b>, near the end, <span class="error">new&nbsp;<b>Map</b>&lt;String,String&gt;()</span> is
an error since <i>Map</i> is an interface, not a class.  It should be
<span class="fix">new&nbsp;<b>TreeMap</b>&lt;String,String&gt;()</span>.</li>
</ul>
