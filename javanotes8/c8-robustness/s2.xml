<section id="robustness.2" title="Writing Correct Programs">

<p><start><big>C</big>orrect programs don't</start> just happen. It takes
planning and attention to detail to avoid errors in programs. There are some
techniques that programmers can use to increase the likelihood that their
programs are correct.</p>

<subsection id="robustness.2.1" title="Provably Correct Programs">
   
<p>In some cases, it is possible to <b>prove</b> that a program is
correct. That is, it is possible to demonstrate mathematically that the
sequence of computations represented by the program will always produce the
correct result. Rigorous proof is difficult enough that in practice it can only
be applied to fairly small programs. Furthermore, it depends on the fact that
the "correct result" has been specified correctly and completely. As I've
already pointed out, a program that correctly meets its specification is not
useful if its specification was wrong. Nevertheless, even in everyday
programming, we can apply some of the ideas and techniques that are used in
proving that programs are correct.</p>

<p>The fundamental ideas are <newword>process</newword> and
<newword>state</newword>. A state consists of all the information
relevant to the execution of a program at a given moment during its execution.
The state includes, for example, the values of all the
variables in the program, the output that has been produced, any input that is
waiting to be read, and a record of the position in the program where the
computer is working. A process is the sequence of states that the computer goes
through as it executes the program. From this point of view, the meaning of a
statement in a program can be expressed in terms of the effect that the
execution of that statement has on the computer's state. As a simple example,
the meaning of the assignment statement "<code>x&nbsp;=&nbsp;7;</code>" is that
after this statement is executed, the value of the variable <code>x</code> will be
7. We can be absolutely sure of this fact, so it is something upon which we can
build part of a mathematical proof.</p>

<p>In fact, it is often possible to look at a program and deduce that some fact
must be true at a given point during the execution of a program. For example,
consider the <code>do</code> loop:</p>

<pre>do {
   System.out.print("Enter a positive integer: ");
   N = TextIO.getlnInt();
} while (N &lt;= 0);</pre>

<np>After this loop ends, we can be absolutely sure that the value of the
variable <code>N</code> is greater than zero. The loop cannot end until this
condition is satisfied. This fact is part of the meaning of the <code>while</code>
loop. More generally, if a <code>while</code> loop uses the test "<code>while
(<bnf>condition</bnf>)</code>", then after the loop ends, we can be
sure that the <code><bnf>condition</bnf></code> is false. We can then
use this fact to draw further deductions about what happens as the execution of
the program continues. (With a loop, by the way, we also have to worry about
the question of whether the loop will ever end. This is something that has to
be verified separately.)</np>

<p>A fact that can be proven to be true after a given program segment has been
executed is called a <newword>postcondition</newword> of that program
segment. Postconditions are known facts upon which we can build further
deductions about the behavior of the program. A postcondition of a program as a
whole is simply a fact that can be proven to be true after the program has
finished executing. A program can be proven to be correct by showing that the
postconditions of the program meet the program's specification.</p>

<p>Consider the following program segment, where all the variables are of type
<ptype>double</ptype>:</p>

<pre>disc = B*B - 4*A*C;
x = (-B + Math.sqrt(disc)) / (2*A);</pre>

<np>The quadratic formula (from high-school mathematics) assures us that the
value assigned to <code>x</code> is a solution of the equation <code>A*x<sup>2</sup> +
B*x + C = 0</code>, provided that the value of <code>disc</code> is greater than or equal
to zero and the value of <code>A</code> is not zero. <b>If</b> we can assume or
guarantee that <code>B*B-4*A*C&nbsp;&gt;=&nbsp;0</code> and that <code>A&nbsp;!=&nbsp;0</code>, then the
fact that <code>x</code> is a solution of the equation becomes a postcondition of
the program segment. We say that the condition, <code>B*B-4*A*C&nbsp;&gt;=&nbsp;0</code> is a
<newword>precondition</newword> of the program segment. The condition
that <code>A&nbsp;!=&nbsp;0</code> is another precondition. A precondition is defined to be a
condition that must be true at a given point in the execution of a program in
order for the program to continue correctly. A precondition is something that
you want to be true. It's something that you have to check or force to be true,
if you want your program to be correct.</np>

<p>We've encountered preconditions and postconditions once before, in <localref href="subroutines.6.1"/>.
That section introduced preconditions and
postconditions as a way of specifying the contract of a subroutine. As the
terms are being used here, a precondition of a subroutine is just a
precondition of the code that makes up the definition of the subroutine, and
the postcondition of a subroutine is a postcondition of the same code. In this
section, we have generalized these terms to make them more useful in talking
about program correctness.</p>

<p>Let's see how this works by considering a longer program segment:</p>

<pre>do {
   System.out.println("Enter A, B, and C.  B*B-4*A*C must be &gt;= 0.");
   System.out.print("A = ");
   A = TextIO.getlnDouble();
   System.out.print("B = ");
   B = TextIO.getlnDouble();
   System.out.print("C = ");
   C = TextIO.getlnDouble();
   if (A == 0 || B*B - 4*A*C &lt; 0)
      System.out.println("Your input is illegal.  Try again.");
} while (A == 0 || B*B - 4*A*C &lt; 0);

disc = B*B - 4*A*C;
x = (-B + Math.sqrt(disc)) / (2*A);</pre>

<np>After the loop ends, we can be sure that <code>B*B-4*A*C&nbsp;&gt;=&nbsp;0</code> and that
<code>A&nbsp;!=&nbsp;0</code>. The preconditions for the last two lines are fulfilled, so the
postcondition that <code>x</code> is a solution of the equation <code>A*x<sup>2</sup> +
B*x + C = 0</code> is also valid. This program segment correctly and provably computes
a solution to the equation. (Actually, because of problems with representing real
numbers on computers, this is not 100% true. The <b>algorithm</b> is correct,
but the <b>program</b> is not a perfect implementation of the algorithm. See
the discussion in <localref href="robustness.1.3"/>.)</np>

<p>Here is another variation, in which the precondition is checked by an
<code>if</code> statement. In the first part of the <code>if</code> statement, where a
solution is computed and printed, we know that the preconditions are fulfilled.
In the other parts, we know that one of the preconditions fails to hold. In any
case, the program is correct.</p>

<pre>System.out.println("Enter your values for A, B, and C.");
System.out.print("A = ");
A = TextIO.getlnDouble();
System.out.print("B = ");
B = TextIO.getlnDouble();
System.out.print("C = ");
C = TextIO.getlnDouble();

if (A != 0 &amp;&amp; B*B - 4*A*C &gt;= 0) {
   disc = B*B - 4*A*C;
   x = (-B + Math.sqrt(disc)) / (2*A);
   System.out.println("A solution of A*X*X + B*X + C = 0 is " + x);
}
else if (A == 0) {
   System.out.println("The value of A cannot be zero.");
}
else {
   System.out.println("Since B*B - 4*A*C is less than zero, the");
   System.out.println("equation A*X*X + B*X + C = 0 has no solution.");
}</pre>

<p>Whenever you write a program, it's a good idea to watch out for
preconditions and think about how your program handles them. Often, a
precondition can offer a clue about how to write the program.</p>

<p>For example, every array reference, such as <code>A[i]</code>, has a
precondition: The index must be within the range of legal indices for the
array. For <code>A[i]</code>, the precondition is that <code>0&nbsp;&lt;=&nbsp;i 
&lt;&nbsp;A.length</code>. The computer will check this condition when it evaluates
<code>A[i]</code>, and if the condition is not satisfied, the program will be
terminated. In order to avoid this, you need to make sure that the index has a
legal value. (There is actually another precondition, namely that <code>A</code> is
not <code>null</code>, but let's leave that aside for the moment.) Consider the
following code, which searches for the number <code>x</code> in the array
<code>A</code> and sets the value of <code>i</code> to be the index of
the array element that contains <code>x</code>:</p>

<pre>i = 0;
while (A[i] != x) {
   i++;
}</pre>

<np>As this program segment stands, it has a precondition, namely that
<code>x</code> is actually in the array. If this precondition is satisfied, then
the loop will end when <code>A[i]&nbsp;==&nbsp;x</code>. That is, the value of <code>i</code>
when the loop ends will be the position of <code>x</code> in the array. However, if
<code>x</code> is not in the array, then the value of <code>i</code> will just keep
increasing until it is equal to <code>A.length</code>. At that time, the reference
to <code>A[i]</code> is illegal and the program will be terminated. To avoid this,
we can add a test to make sure that the precondition for referring to
<code>A[i]</code> is satisfied:</np>

<pre>i = 0;
while (<newcode>i &lt; A.length</newcode> &amp;&amp; A[i] != x) {
   i++;
}</pre>

<np>Now, the loop will definitely end. After it ends, <code>i</code> will satisfy
<b>either</b> <code>i&nbsp;==&nbsp;A.length</code> or <code>A[i]&nbsp;==&nbsp;x</code>. 
An <code>if</code> statement
can be used after the loop to test which of these conditions caused the loop to
end:</np>

<pre>i = 0;
while (i &lt; A.length &amp;&amp; A[i] != x) {
   i++;
}

if (i == A.length)
   System.out.println("x is not in the array");
else
   System.out.println("x is in position " + i);</pre>

<subsection id="robustness.2.2" title="Robust Handling of Input">

<p>One place where correctness and robustness are important&mdash;and especially
difficult&mdash;is in the processing of input data, whether that data is typed in
by the user, read from a file, or received over a network. Files and networking
will be covered in <localref href="IO"/>, which will
make essential use of material that will be covered in the <localref href="robustness.3">next section</localref> 
of this chapter. For now, let's look at an example of processing user input.</p>

<p>Examples in this textbook use my <classname>TextIO</classname> class for reading input
from the user. This class has built-in error handling. For example, the
function <code>TextIO.getDouble()</code> is guaranteed to return a legal value of
type <ptype>double</ptype>. If the user types an illegal value, then
<classname>TextIO</classname> will ask the user to re-enter their response; your
program never sees the illegal value.  However, this approach can be
clumsy and unsatisfactory, especially when the user is entering complex data.
In the following example, I'll do my own error-checking.</p>

<p>Sometimes, it's useful to be able to look ahead at what's coming up in the
input without actually reading it. For example, a program might need to know
whether the next item in the input is a number or a word. For this purpose, the
<classname>TextIO</classname> class includes the function <code>TextIO.peek()</code>. This
function returns a <ptype>char</ptype> which is the next character in the user's
input, but it does not actually read that character. If the next thing in the
input is an end-of-line, then <code>TextIO.peek()</code> returns the new-line
character, <code>'\n'</code>.</p>

<p>Often, what we really need to know is the next <b>non-blank</b>
character in the user's input. Before we can test this, we need to skip past
any spaces (and tabs). Here is a function that does this. It uses
<code>TextIO.peek()</code> to look ahead, and it reads characters until the next
character in the input is either an end-of-line or some non-blank character.
(The function <code>TextIO.getAnyChar()</code> reads and returns the next character
in the user's input, even if that character is a space. By contrast, the more
common <code>TextIO.getChar()</code> would skip any blanks and then read and return
the next non-blank character. We can't use <code>TextIO.getChar()</code> here since
the object is to skip the blanks <b>without</b> reading the next
non-blank character.)</p>

<pre>/**
 * Reads past any blanks and tabs in the input.
 * Postcondition:  The next character in the input is an
 *                 end-of-line or a non-blank character.
 */
static void skipBlanks() {
   char ch;
   ch = TextIO.peek();
   while (ch == ' ' || ch == '\t') {
         // Next character is a space or tab; read it
         // and look at the character that follows it.
      ch = TextIO.getAnyChar();
      ch = TextIO.peek();
   }
} // end skipBlanks()</pre>
   
<np>(In fact, this operation is so common that it is built into 
<code>TextIO</code>.  The method <code>TextIO.skipBlanks()</code>
does essentially the same thing as the <code>skipBlanks()</code> method
presented here.)</np>

<p>An example in <localref href="control.5.3"/> allowed the user to
enter length measurements such as "3 miles" or "1 foot". It would then convert
the measurement into inches, feet, yards, and miles. But people commonly use
combined measurements such as "3 feet 7 inches". Let's improve the program so
that it allows inputs of this form.</p>

<p>More specifically, the user will input lines containing one or more
measurements such as "1 foot" or "3 miles 20 yards 2 feet". The legal units of
measure are inch, foot, yard, and mile. The program will also recognize plurals
(inches, feet, yards, miles) and abbreviations (in, ft, yd, mi). Let's write a
subroutine that will read one line of input of this form and compute the
equivalent number of inches. The main program uses the number of inches to
compute the equivalent number of feet, yards, and miles. If there is any error
in the input, the subroutine will print an error message and return the value
<code>-1</code>. The subroutine assumes that the input line is not empty. The main program
tests for this before calling the subroutine and uses an empty line as a signal
for ending the program.</p>

<p>Ignoring the possibility of illegal inputs, a pseudocode algorithm for the
subroutine is</p>

<pre>inches = 0    // This will be the total number of inches
while there is more input on the line:
    read the numerical measurement
    read the units of measure
    add the measurement to inches
return inches</pre>

<np>We can test whether there is more input on the line by checking whether the
next non-blank character is the end-of-line character. But this test has a
precondition: Before we can test the next non-blank character, we have to skip
over any blanks. So, the algorithm becomes</np>

<pre>inches = 0
skipBlanks()
while TextIO.peek() is not '\n':
    read the numerical measurement
    read the unit of measure
    add the measurement to inches
    skipBlanks()
return inches</pre>

<np>Note the call to <code>skipBlanks()</code> at the end of the <code>while</code>
loop. This subroutine must be executed before the computer returns to the test
at the beginning of the loop. More generally, if the test in a <code>while</code>
loop has a precondition, then you have to make sure that this precondition
holds at the <b>end</b> of the while loop, before the computer jumps
back to re-evaluate the test, as well as before the start of the loop.</np>

<p>What about error checking? Before reading the numerical measurement, we have
to make sure that there is really a number there to read. Before reading the
unit of measure, we have to test that there is something there to read. (The
number might have been the last thing on the line. An input such as "3",
without a unit of measure, is not acceptable.) Also, we have to check that the unit of
measure is one of the valid units: inches, feet, yards, or miles. Here is an
algorithm that includes error-checking:</p>

<pre>inches = 0
skipBlanks()

while TextIO.peek() is not '\n':

    if the next character is not a digit:
       report an error and return -1
    Let measurement = TextIO.getDouble();

    skipBlanks()    // Precondition for the next test!!
    if the next character is end-of-line:
       report an error and return -1                   
    Let units = TextIO.getWord()
    
    if the units are inches:
        add measurement to inches
    else if the units are feet:
        add 12*measurement to inches
    else if the units are yards:
        add 36*measurement to inches
    else if the units are miles:
        add 12*5280*measurement to inches
    else
        report an error and return -1
 
    skipBlanks()

return inches</pre>

<p>As you can see, error-testing adds significantly to the complexity of the
algorithm. Yet this is still a fairly simple example, and it doesn't even
handle all the possible errors. For example, if the user enters a numerical
measurement such as <code>1e400</code> that is outside the legal range of values of type
<ptype>double</ptype>, then the program will fall back on the default error-handling
in <classname>TextIO</classname>. 
Something even more interesting happens if the measurement is "1e308 miles".
The number <code>1e308</code> is legal, but the corresponding number of inches is outside
the legal range of values for type <ptype>double</ptype>. As mentioned in the 
<localref href="robustness.1.3">previous section</localref>, 
the computer will get the value <code>Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY</code>
when it does the computation. You might want to run the program and try this out.</p>

<p>Here is the subroutine written out in Java:</p>

<pre>/**
 * Reads the user's input measurement from one line of input.
 * Precondition:   The input line is not empty.
 * Postcondition:  If the user's input is legal, the measurement
 *                 is converted to inches and returned.  If the
 *                 input is not legal, the value -1 is returned.
 *                 The end-of-line is NOT read by this routine.
 */
