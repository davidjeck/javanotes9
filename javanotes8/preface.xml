<p><start><big>I</big>ntroduction to Programming Using Java</start> is a free
introductory computer programming textbook that uses Java as the language of
instruction.  It is suitable for use in an introductory programming course
and for people who are trying to learn programming on their own. There are
no prerequisites beyond a general familiarity with the ideas of computers and
programs.  There is enough material for a full year of college-level
programming.  Chapters 1 through 7 can be used as a textbook in a one-semester
college-level course or in a year-long high school course.  The remaining
chapters can be covered in a second course.</p>

<p>The Seventh Edition of the book covers "Java&nbsp;7."  The most recent
version of Java is 8, but this book has only a few very short mentions of
the new features in Java&nbsp;8.</p>
   
<p>The home web site for this book is
<a href="http://math.hws.edu/javanotes/">http://math.hws.edu/javanotes/</a>.
The page at that address contains links for downloading a copy of
the web site and for downloading PDF versions of the book.
The web site&mdash;and the web site download&mdash;includes source code for the sample programs that are
discussed in the text, answers to end-of-chapter quizzes and a discussion
and solution for each end-of-chapter exercises.  Readers are encouraged
to download the source code for the examples and to read and run the
programs as they read the book.  Readers are also strongly encouraged
to read the exercise solutions if they want to get the most out of this book.</p>


<p>In style, this is a textbook rather than a tutorial. That is, it
concentrates on explaining concepts rather than giving step-by-step
how-to-do-it guides.
I have tried to use a conversational writing style that
might be closer to classroom lecture than to a typical textbook. This is
certainly not a Java reference book, and it is not a
comprehensive survey of all the features of Java. It is <b>not</b> written as
a quick introduction to Java for people who already know another programming
language. Instead, it is directed mainly towards people who are learning
programming for the first time, and it is as much about general programming
concepts as it is about Java in particular. I believe that <i>Introduction to
Programming using Java</i> is fully competitive with the conventionally
published, printed programming textbooks that are available on the market.
(Well, all right, I'll confess that I think it's better.)</p>

<p>There are several approaches to teaching Java. One approach uses
graphical user interface programming from the very beginning. Some people
believe that object oriented programming should also be emphasized from the
very beginning. This is <b>not</b> the approach that I take. The approach that I favor
starts with the more basic building blocks of programming and builds from
there. After an introductory chapter,
I cover procedural programming in Chapters 2, 3, and&nbsp;4.
Object-oriented programming is introduced in Chapter&nbsp;5. Chapter&nbsp;6
covers the closely related topic of event-oriented programming and
graphical user interfaces. Arrays are introduced in Chapter&nbsp;3 with a full treatment in Chapter&nbsp;7.
Chapter&nbsp;8 is a short chapter that marks a turning point in the book, moving beyond the
fundamental ideas of programming to cover more advanced topics.
Chapter&nbsp;8 is about writing robust, correct, and efficient programs.
Chapters&nbsp;9 and 10 cover recursion and data structures, including the Java Collection
Framework.  Chapter&nbsp;11 is about files and networking.  Chapter&nbsp;12
covers threads and parallel processing.  Finally,
Chapter&nbsp;13 returns to the topic of graphical user interface programming
to cover some of Java's more advanced capabilities.</p>

<p>The Seventh Edition of "Introduction to Programming using Java" is not a huge update from
the sixth edition.  In fact, my main motivation for the new version was to remove any 
use of applets or coverage of applets from the book.  Applets are Java programs that run on a web page.
When Java first came out, they were exciting, and it seemed like they would become a major
way of creating active content for the Web.  Up until the sixth edition, the web pages for this
book included applets for running many of the sample programs.
However, because of security issues and the emergence of other technologies, applets are 
no longer widely used.  Furthermore, the most recent versions of 
Java  made it fairly difficult and unpleasant to use the applets in the book.  In place
of applets, I have tried to make it as easy as possible for readers to download the
sample programs and run them on their own computers.</p>

<p>Another significant change in the seventh edition is that arrays are now introduced in
Chapter&nbsp;3 in a basic form that is used throughout the next three chapters.  Previously,
arrays were not introduced until Chapter&nbsp;7, after objects and GUI programming had already
been covered.  Much of the more advanced coverage of arrays is still in Chapter&nbsp;7.</p>

<p>Aside from that, there are many small improvements throughout, mostly related to features
that were new in Java&nbsp;7.  Version 7.0.3 is the final release of the seventh edition.</p>

<p><b>A technical note on production:</b> The on-line and PDF versions of this
book are created from a single source, which is written largely in XML. 
To produce the
PDF version, the XML is processed into a form that can be used by the TeX
typesetting program.  In addition to
XML files, the source includes DTDs, XSLT transformations, Java source code files,
image files, a TeX macro file, and a couple of scripts that are used in processing.
The scripts work on Linux and on Mac&nbsp;OS.
</p>

<p><b>I have made the complete source files available for download at
the following address:</b></p>

<p>These files were not originally meant for publication, and therefore are not very
cleanly written.  Furthermore, it requires a fair amount of expertise to use them.
However, I have had several requests for the sources and have made
them available on an "as-is" basis.  For more information about the sources and
how they are used see the <tex>README file</tex><web><a href="README-full-source.txt">README&nbsp;file</a></web> from
