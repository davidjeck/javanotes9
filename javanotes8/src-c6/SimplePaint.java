 * A simple panel where the user can sketch curves in a variety of
 * colors.  A color palette is shown along the right edge of the panel.
 * The user can select a drawing color by clicking on a color in the
 * palette.  Under the colors is a "Clear button" that the user
 * can click to clear the sketch.  The user draws by clicking and
 * dragging in a large white area that occupies most of the panel.
 * The user's drawing is not persistent.  It is lost whenever
 * the panel is repainted for any reason.
 * <p>The drawing that is done in this example violates the rule
 * that all drawing should be done in the paintComponent() method.
 * Although it works, it is NOT good style.
