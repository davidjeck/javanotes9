/*
 * This is a GUI version of TextIO, which does I/O in a window rather than
 * on the command line.  It is not meant to work with every program, but will
 * work with all the TextIO examples in "Introduction to Programming Using Java,"
 * Version 8 (http://math.hws.edu/javanotes).  To use it, add the imports
 * 
 *      import textiogui.TextIO;
 *      import textiogui.System;
 * 
 * to the top of the Java file.  (Alternatively, you could simply add the unmodified
 * java file to the package textiogui.)  The second import is necessary only if the
 * program uses the standard System class; the import substitutes a bogus System
 * class that does I/O in the TextIO GUI window instead of on the command line.
 * This is a hack, but it work.  Note that the bogus System class does not have
 * all the subroutines of the regular System class, and that System.out and System.err
 * are PrintWriters rather than PrintStreams, and that System.in is a BufferedReader.
 *
 * Important note:  You must use two separate import statements; import textiogui.*; won't \
 * work, since with that import, Java won't know which System class to use.
 * 
 * Note that after the program ends, you will have to close the window, unless the program
 * itself calls System.exit.
 * 
 * I use this class to make executable jar files that demo my TextIO programs, using
 * a window instead of the command line.
