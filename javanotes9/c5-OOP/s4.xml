<section id="OOP.4" title="Programming Example: Card, Hand, Deck">


<p>In this section, we look at some specific examples of object-oriented design
in a domain that is simple enough that we have a
chance of coming up with something reasonably reusable. Consider card games
that are played with a standard deck of playing cards (a so-called "poker"
deck, since it is used in the game of poker).</p>
   
<subsection id="OOP.4.1" title="Designing the classes">

<p>In a typical card game, each
player gets a hand of cards. The deck is shuffled and cards are dealt one at a
time from the deck and added to the players' hands. In some games, cards can be
removed from a hand, and new cards can be added. The game is won or lost
depending on the value (ace, 2, 3, &dots;, king) and suit (spades, diamonds, clubs,
hearts) of the cards that a player receives. If we look for nouns in this
description, there are several candidates for objects: game, player, hand,
card, deck, value, and suit. Of these, the value and the suit of a card are
simple values, and they might just be represented as instance variables in a
<classname>Card</classname> object. In a complete program, the other five nouns might be
represented by classes. But let's work on the ones that are most obviously
reusable: <i>card</i>, <i>hand</i>, and <i>deck</i>.</p>

<p>If we look for verbs in the description of a card game, we see that we can
<i>shuffle</i> a deck and <i>deal</i> a card from a deck. This gives use us two candidates
for instance methods in a <classname>Deck</classname> class: <code>shuffle()</code>
and <code>dealCard()</code>. Cards can be added to and
removed from hands. This gives two candidates for instance methods in a
<classname>Hand</classname> class: <code>addCard()</code> and <code>removeCard()</code>.
Cards are relatively passive things, but we at least need to be
able to determine their suits and values. We will discover more instance
methods as we go along.</p>

   
<p>First, we'll design the deck class in detail. When a deck of cards is first
created, it contains 52 cards in some standard order. The <classname>Deck</classname> class
will need a constructor to create a new deck. The constructor needs no
parameters because any new deck is the same as any other. There will be an
instance method called <code>shuffle()</code> that will rearrange the 52 cards into
a random order. The <code>dealCard()</code> instance method will get the next card
from the deck. This will be a function with a return type of <code>Card</code>,
since the caller needs to know what card is being dealt. It has no parameters&mdash;when
you deal the next card from the deck, you don't provide any information to the
deck; you just get the next card, whatever it is.
What will happen if there are no more cards in the deck when its
<code>dealCard()</code> method is called? It should probably be considered an error
to try to deal a card from an empty deck, so the deck can throw an exception in that case.
But this raises another question: How
will the rest of the program know whether the deck is empty? Of course, the
program could keep track of how many cards it has used. But the deck itself
should know how many cards it has left, so the program should just be able to
ask the deck object. We can make this possible by specifying another instance
method, <code>cardsLeft()</code>, that returns the number of cards remaining in the
deck. This leads to a full specification of all the subroutines in the
<classname>Deck</classname> class:</p>

<pre><b>Constructor and instance methods in class Deck:</b>

     /**
      * Constructor.  Create an unshuffled deck of cards.
      */
     public Deck()

     /**
      * Put all the used cards back into the deck,
      * and shuffle it into a random order.
      */
     public void shuffle()

     /**
      * As cards are dealt from the deck, the number of 
      * cards left decreases.  This function returns the 
      * number of cards that are still left in the deck.
      */
     public int cardsLeft()

     /**
      * Deals one card from the deck and returns it.
      * @throws IllegalStateException if no more cards are left.
      */
     public Card dealCard()</pre>

<np>This is everything you need to know in order to <b>use</b> the <code>Deck</code> class.
Of course, it doesn't tell us how to write the class. This has been an exercise
in design, not in coding.  You can look at the source
code, <sourceref href="Deck.java"/>, if you want. 
It should not be a surprise that the class includes
an array of <classname>Cards</classname> as an instance variable, but there
are a few things you might not understand at this point.  Of course,
you can use the class in your programs as a black box,
without understanding the implementation.</np>

<p>We can do a similar analysis for the <classname>Hand</classname> class. When a hand object
is first created, it has no cards in it. An <code>addCard()</code> instance method
will add a card to the hand. This method needs a parameter of type
<classname>Card</classname> to specify which card is being added. For the
<code>removeCard()</code> method, a parameter is needed to specify which card to
remove. But should we specify the card itself ("Remove the ace of spades"), or
should we specify the card by its position in the hand ("Remove the third card
in the hand")? Actually, we don't have to decide, since we can allow for both
options. We'll have two <code>removeCard()</code> instance methods, one with a
parameter of type <classname>Card</classname> specifying the card to be removed and one with
a parameter of type <ptype>int</ptype> specifying the position of the card in the
hand. (Remember that you can have two methods in a class with the same name,
provided they have different numbers or types of parameters.) Since a hand can contain a
variable number of cards, it's convenient to be able to ask a hand object how
many cards it contains. So, we need an instance method <code>getCardCount()</code>
that returns the number of cards in the hand. When I play cards, I like to
arrange the cards in my hand so that cards of the same value are next to each
other. Since this is a generally useful thing to be able to do, we can provide
instance methods for sorting the cards in the hand. Here is a full
specification for a reusable <classname>Hand</classname> class:</p>

<pre>
<b>Constructor and instance methods in class Hand:</b>

    /**
     * Constructor. Create a Hand object that is initially empty.
     */
    public Hand()

    /**
     * Discard all cards from the hand, making the hand empty.
     */
    public void clear()

    /**
     * Add the card c to the hand.  c should be non-null.
     * @throws NullPointerException if c is null.
     */
    public void addCard(Card c)

    /**
     * If the specified card is in the hand, it is removed.
     */
    public void removeCard(Card c)

    /**
     * Remove the card in the specified position from the
     * hand.  Cards are numbered counting from zero.
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if the specified 
     *    position does not exist in the hand.
     */
    public void removeCard(int position)

    /**
     * Return the number of cards in the hand.
     */
    public int getCardCount()

    /**
     * Get the card from the hand in given position, where 
     * positions are numbered starting from 0.
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if the specified 
     *    position does not exist in the hand.
     */
    public Card getCard(int position)

    /**
     * Sorts the cards in the hand so that cards of the same 
     * suit are grouped together, and within a suit the cards 
     * are sorted by value.
     */
    public void sortBySuit()

    /**
     * Sorts the cards in the hand so that cards are sorted into
     * order of increasing value.  Cards with the same value 
     * are sorted by suit. Note that aces are considered
     * to have the lowest value.
     */
    public void sortByValue()</pre>

<np>Again, there are a few things in the implementation of the class that
you won't understand at this point, but that doesn't stop you from
using the class in your projects.   The source code can be found in
the file <sourceref href="Hand.java"/></np>
   
</subsection>
   
<subsection id="OOP.4.2" title="The Card Class">

<p>We will look at the design and implementation of a <classname>Card</classname>
class in full detail. The class will have a constructor that specifies the value and suit of
the card that is being created. There are four suits, which can be represented
by the integers 0, 1, 2, and 3. It would be tough to remember which number
represents which suit, so I've defined named constants in the <classname>Card</classname>
class to represent the four possibilities. For example, <code>Card.SPADES</code> is
a constant that represents the suit, "spades." (These constants are declared to
be <code>public</code> <code>final</code> <code>static</code> <code>ints</code>. 
It might be better to use an enumerated type, but I will stick here to
integer-valued constants.)  The possible
values of a card are the numbers 1, 2, &dots;, 13, with 1 standing for an ace, 11
for a jack, 12 for a queen, and 13 for a king. Again, I've defined some named
constants to represent the values of aces and face cards.  (When you read the
<classname>Card</classname> class, you'll see that I've also added support for
Jokers.)</p>
   
<p>A <classname>Card</classname> object can be constructed knowing the value and
the suit of the card.  For example, we can call the constructor with statements
such as:</p>

<pre>card1 = new Card( Card.ACE, Card.SPADES );  // Construct ace of spades.
card2 = new Card( 10, Card.DIAMONDS );   // Construct 10 of diamonds.
card3 = new Card( v, s );  // This is OK, as long as v and s 
                           //               are integer expressions.</pre>

<p>A <classname>Card</classname> object needs instance variables to represent its value and
suit. I've made these <code>private</code> so that they cannot be changed from
outside the class, and I've provided getter methods <code>getSuit()</code> and
<code>getValue()</code> so that it will be possible to discover the suit and value
from outside the class. The instance variables are initialized in the
constructor, and are never changed after that. In fact, I've declared the
instance variables <code>suit</code> and <code>value</code> to be <code>final</code>, since
they are never changed after they are initialized. An instance variable can be
declared <code>final</code> provided it is either given an initial value in its
declaration or is initialized in every constructor in the class.  Since all its
instance variables are <code>final</code>, a <classname>Card</classname> is
an immutable object.</p>

<p>Finally, I've added a few convenience methods to the class to make it easier
to print out cards in a human-readable form. For example, I want to be able to
print out the suit of a card as the word "Diamonds", rather than as the
meaningless code number 2, which is used in the class to represent diamonds.
Since this is something that I'll probably have to do in many programs, it
makes sense to include support for it in the class. So, I've provided instance
methods <code>getSuitAsString()</code> and <code>getValueAsString()</code> to return
string representations of the suit and value of a card. Finally, I've defined the
instance method <code>toString()</code> to return a string with both the value
and suit, such as "Queen of Hearts".  Recall that this method will be used automatically
whenever a <classname>Card</classname> needs to be converted into a <classname>String</classname>, such as
when the card is concatenated onto a string with the <code>+</code> operator.
Thus, the statement</p>

<pre>System.out.println( "Your card is the " + card );</pre>

<np>is equivalent to</np>

<pre>System.out.println( "Your card is the " + card.toString() );</pre>

<np>If the card is the queen of hearts, either of these will print out "Your
card is the Queen of Hearts".</np>

<p>Here is the complete <classname>Card</classname> class, which can also
be found in <sourceref href="Card.java"/>.  This class is general enough to be highly
reusable, so the work that went into designing, writing, and testing it pays
off handsomely in the long run.</p>

<subsection id="OOP.4.3" title="Example: A Simple Card Game">

<p>I will finish this section by presenting a complete program that uses the
<classname>Card</classname> and <classname>Deck</classname> classes. The program lets the user play a very
simple card game called HighLow. A deck of cards is shuffled, and one card is
dealt from the deck and shown to the user. The user predicts whether the next
card from the deck will be higher or lower than the current card. If the user
predicts correctly, then the next card from the deck becomes the current card,
and the user makes another prediction. This continues until the user makes an
incorrect prediction. The number of correct predictions is the user's
score.</p>

<p>My program has a static method that plays one game of HighLow. The
<code>main()</code> routine lets the user play several games of HighLow. At the
end, it reports the user's average score.</p>

<p>I won't go through the development of the algorithms used in this program,
but I encourage you to read it carefully and make sure that you understand how
it works.  Note in particular that the subroutine that plays one game
of HighLow returns the user's score in the game as its return value.
This gets the score back to the main program, where it is needed.
Here is the program:</p>
