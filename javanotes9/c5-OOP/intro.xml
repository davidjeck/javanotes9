<intro><p><start><big>W</big>hereas a subroutine</start> represents a single task, an
object can encapsulate both data (in the form of instance variables) and a
number of different tasks or "behaviors" related to that data (in the form of
instance methods). Therefore objects provide another, more sophisticated type
of structure that can be used to help manage the complexity of large
programs.</p>

<p>The first four
sections of this chapter introduce the basic things you need to know to work with objects
and to define simple classes.  The remaining sections cover more advanced topics; you
might not understand them fully the first time through.  In particular,
<localref href="OOP.5"/> covers the most central ideas of object-oriented programming: inheritance and
polymorphism.  However, in this textbook, we will generally use these ideas in a
limited form, by creating independent classes and building on existing classes
rather than by designing entire hierarchies of classes from scratch.
