<section id="overview.4" title="Fundamental Building Blocks of Programs" shorttitle="Building Blocks of Programs">
    
<p><start><big>T</big>here are two basic aspects</start> of programming: data
and instructions. To work with data, you need to understand <newword>variables</newword> 
and <newword>types</newword>; to work with
instructions, you need to understand <newword>control structures</newword> 
and <newword>subroutines</newword>. You'll spend a
large part of the course becoming familiar with these concepts.</p>

<p>A <newword>variable</newword> is just a memory location (or
several consecutive locations treated as a unit) that has been given a name so that it can
be easily referred to and used in a program. The programmer only has to worry
about the name; it is the compiler's responsibility to keep track of the memory
location. As a programmer, you just need to keep in mind that the name refers to a
kind of "box" in memory that can hold data, even though you don't have
to know where in memory that box is located.</p>

<p>In Java and in many other programming languages, a variable has a <newword>type</newword>
that indicates what sort of data it can hold. One type of
variable might hold integers&mdash;whole numbers such as 3, -7, and 0&mdash;while
another holds floating point numbers&mdash;numbers with decimal points such as
3.14, -2.7, or 17.0. (Yes, the computer does make a distinction between the
integer 17 and the floating-point number 17.0; they actually look quite
different inside the computer.) There could also be types for individual
characters ('A', ';', etc.), strings ("Hello", "A string can include many
characters", etc.), and less common types such as dates, colors, sounds, or any
other kind of data that a program might need to store.</p>

<p>Programming languages always have commands for getting data into and out of
variables and for doing computations with data. For example, the following
"assignment statement," which might appear in a Java program, tells the
computer to take the number stored in the variable named "principal", multiply
that number by 0.07, and then store the result in the variable named
"interest":</p>

<pre>interest = principal * 0.07;</pre>

<np>There are also "input commands" for getting data from the user or from files
on the computer's disks, and there are "output commands" for sending data in the other
direction.</np>

<p>These basic commands&mdash;for moving data from place to place and for
performing computations&mdash;are the building blocks for all programs. These
building blocks are combined into complex programs using control structures and
subroutines.</p>

<break/>

<p>A program is a sequence of instructions. In the ordinary "flow of control,"
the computer executes the instructions in the sequence in which they occur in the program,
one after the other. However, this is obviously very limited: the computer
would soon run out of instructions to execute. <newword>Control structures</newword> 
are special instructions that can change the flow of control.
There are two basic types of control structure: <newword>loops</newword>,
which allow a sequence of instructions to be repeated
over and over, and <newword>branches</newword>, which allow the
computer to decide between two or more different courses of action by testing
conditions that occur as the program is running.</p>

<p>For example, it might be that if the value of the variable "principal" is
greater than 10000, then the "interest" should be computed by multiplying the
principal by 0.05; if not, then the interest should be computed by multiplying
the principal by 0.04. A program needs some way of expressing this type of
decision. In Java, it could be expressed using the following "if
statement":</p>

<pre>if (principal &gt; 10000)
    interest = principal * 0.05;
else
    interest = principal * 0.04;</pre>

<np>(Don't worry about the details for now. Just remember that the computer can
test a condition and decide what to do next on the basis of that test.)</np>

<p>Loops are used when the same task has to be performed more than once. For
example, if you want to print out a mailing label for each name on a mailing
list, you might say, "Get the first name and address and print the label; get
the second name and address and print the label; get the third name and address
and print the label&dots;" But this quickly becomes ridiculous&mdash;and might not
work at all if you don't know in advance how many names there are. What you
would like to say is something like "While there are more names to process, get
the next name and address, and print the label." A loop can be used in a
program to express such repetition.</p>

<break/>

<p>Large programs are so complex that it would be almost impossible to write
them if there were not some way to break them up into manageable "chunks."
Subroutines provide one way to do this. A <newword>subroutine</newword> 
consists of the instructions for performing some
task, grouped together as a unit and given a name. That name can then be used
as a substitute for the whole set of instructions. For example, suppose that
one of the tasks that your program needs to perform is to draw a house on the
screen. You can take the necessary instructions, make them into a subroutine,
and give that subroutine some appropriate name&mdash;say, "drawHouse()". Then
anyplace in your program where you need to draw a house, you can do so with the
single command:</p>

<pre>drawHouse();</pre>

<np>This will have the same effect as repeating all the house-drawing
instructions in each place.</np>

<p>The advantage here is not just that you save typing. Organizing your program
into subroutines also helps you organize your thinking and your program design
effort. While writing the house-drawing subroutine, you can concentrate on the
problem of drawing a house without worrying for the moment about the rest of
the program. And once the subroutine is written, you can forget about the
details of drawing houses&mdash;that problem is solved, since you have a
subroutine to do it for you. A subroutine becomes just like a built-in part of
the language which you can use without thinking about the details of what goes
on "inside" the subroutine.</p>

<break/>

<p>Variables, types, loops, branches, and subroutines are the basis of what
might be called "traditional programming." However, as programs become larger,
additional structure is needed to help deal with their complexity. One of the
most effective tools that has been found is object-oriented programming, which
is discussed in the next section.</p>
