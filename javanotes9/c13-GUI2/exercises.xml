<exercise-question><p>The folder <sourceref href="nature-images"/> contains several pictures of
animals.  (In the web site download, you can find that folder in the <code>chapter13</code> directory
inside the <code>source</code> directory.)
Write a "scratch off" program that could be used by a small child that works as follows:
The program window starts by showing a large uniformly colored rectangle, with one of the
animal pictures hidden behind it.  As the user drags the mouse over the image, part of the
colored overlay is scratched off, revealing the picture underneath.  Here is what it should
look like after part of the overlay has been removed:</p>
<img src="scratch-off.jpg" width="450" height="322" tex="scratch-off.eps" texscale="0.6" alt="a partly revealed bluebird"/>
<np>You can implement this by using one canvas, containing the colored overlay, stacked on top of another
canvas that contains the animal picture.  (Stacked canvases were used in the sample
program <sourceref href="ToolPaint.java"/> from <localref href="GUI2.2.4"/>.)
To implement scratching off part of the overlay, just clear a small rect in the overlay 
canvas around the mouse location.  The program should have some way to move on to the next
picture.  Another idea is to have several different sizes of scratchers, so that an
impatient child can use a giant one that will remove large swatches of color.</np>
</exercise-question>
<exercise-discuss><p>The pictures have to be read into the program as objects of type
<classname>Image</classname>.  I store the pictures into an <atype>ArrayList&lt;Image&gt;</atype>, <code>pictures</code>.
I shuffle them into a random order using the standard function <code>Collections.shuffle()</code>,
so that the pictures will be used in a different order each time the program is run.
An instance variable, <code>nextPicIndex</code>, is used to keep track of which picture is
going to be shown next.</p>

<p>The basic stacked canvas idea is easy to implement.  The two canvases are
placed into a <classname>StackPane</classname>.  An animal picture is drawn in the bottom 
canvas.  The animal pictures are not all the same size, so I picked an arbitrary canvas
size of 800-by-600 and stretched the pictures to fit the canvas, using a <code>drawImage()</code>
method that includes the width and height of the rectangle into which the image is drawn.  At
the same time, I fill the overlay canvas with a random color:</p>

<pre>overlayGraphics.setFill( Color.hsb(360*Math.random(), 0.5, 0.5) );
overlayGraphics.fillRect( 0,0, width,height );
picGraphics.drawImage( pictures.get(nextPicIndex), 0,0, width,height );</pre>

<p>I added some controls at the bottom of the program window: a button that loads the next
picture, a <classname>ComboBox</classname> for selecting the size of the "scratcher,"
and (for the really impatient), a button that will clear the entire overlay canvas.</p>

<exercise-question><p>The <classname>StopWatchLabel</classname>
component from <localref href="GUI2.3.1"/> displays the text "Timing&dots;"
when the stopwatch is running. It would be nice if it displayed the elapsed
time since the stopwatch was started. For that, you need to create an
<classname>AnimationTimer</classname>. (See <localref href="GUI1.3.5"/>.)
Add an <classname>AnimationTimer</classname> to the original source code, 
<sourceref href="StopWatchLabel.java"/>, to drive the display of the elapsed time in
seconds.</p>
</exercise-question>
<exercise-discuss><p>This one is really too easy!  As suggested, I added an
<classname>AnimationTimer</classname>, named <code>timer</code>, as an
instance variable.  (I also changed some of the occurrences of the word "timer"
in the original program to "stopwatch" to try to avoid some confusion:
the stopwatch is a kind of timer, and we are using another kind of timer to
implement it.)  When the stopwatch starts running, it is necessary to call
<code>timer.start()</code> to start the animatino timer running, and when the
stopwatch stops running, <code>timer.stop() must be called.</code>
The only other thing that is needed is to create the <classname>AnimationTimer</classname>
object. Since <classname>AnimationTimer</classname> is an abstract class,
we need a subclass, and we need to provide a definition for the abstract method
<code>handle()</code>.  That method, which will be called 60 times per second,
can update the label to show the elapsed time.  Using an anonymous class,</p>

<pre>timer = new AnimationTimer() {
    public void handle(long now) {
        long elapsedTime = System.currentTimeMillis() - startTime;
        String text = String.format(
                 "%3.1f seconds elapsed", elapsedTime/1000.0);
        setText(text);
    }
};</pre>

<np>In the program, I don't create the animation timer until the first time
the stopwatch is started.  Note that when the stopwatch is stopped, the program
displays the time with three digits after the decimal point.  While it's running,
it doesn't make sense to be that accurate, since the display is only updated
60 times per second.  So, I only use one digit after the decimal point when
the stopwatch is running.</np>

<exercise id="GUI2.ex.2">
<exercise-question><p>Improve the program <sourceref href="ToolPaint.java"/>,
from <localref href="GUI2.2"/>.  You can any improvements you like, but here
are some suggestions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have separate menus for "Fill Color" and "Stroke Color".</li>
<li>Make it possible for the user to draw shapes that are both filled and
stroked.  For example, add two new tools, "Stroked Filled Rect" and
"StrokedFilledOval".</li>
<li>Add a "Line Width" menu.</li>
<li>Add keyboard accelerators for some commands (see <localref href="GUI2.5.4"/>).</li>
<li>Make it possible to use a translucent fill color.  A simple approach to this
is to use a <classname>CheckMenuItem</classname> to select either
fully opaque or 50% opaque fill. I don't advise
trying to implement translucent stroke colors, since that's more difficult.</li>
<li>Add an "Undo" command that will restore the image to what it was before
the last time it was modified.  This can be implemented by making a copy
of the image before you modify it.  It's possible to have a multi-level
undo, but that's harder and uses more memory.</li>
</ul>
<np>Remember that the <code>ToolPaint</code> program requires <sourceref href="SimpleDialogs.java"/>.</np>
</exercise-question>
<exercise-discuss><p>My solutions follows the suggestions for the features to be added.
The individual changes are not too difficult, but there are a lot of them!</p>
<p>To have separate stroke and fill colors, I added a new instance variable, <code>currentStrokeColor</code>
to represent the stroke color.  (I use the original variable, <code>currentColor</code> as the fill
color; I probably should have renamed it <code>currentFillColor</code>.)  I renamed the
"Color" menu to "Fill Color" and I made a new "Stroke Color" menu containing the same set of colors,
including a "Custom Color" command.  This was easy to do: I just copied and edited the code that made
the "Color" menu, omitting the code for the commands having to do with the background color.</p>

<p>The "Stroke Color" menu also contains a <classname>CheckMenuItem</classname> "Translucent Fill,"
which is unchecked by default.  When the user selects this command from the menu, the value of
a global <ptype>boolean</ptype> variable, <code>translucentFill</code>, is set to match the
value of the checkbox.  In the <code>mousePressed()</code> routine, the graphics contexts for the
image canvas and the overlay canvas have to be configured to use the current stroke and fill
colors.  For the fill color, the <code>currentColor</code> variable always stores a
fully opaque color.  If translucent fill is turned on, the actual fill color should have the
same RGB components as <code>currentColor</code>, but its alpha component has to be set to
0.5 for 50% transparency.  (In fact, in the end, I decided that 40% opaqueness looked better than
50%, so I used an alpha of 0.4.)  Here is the code from <code>mousePressed</code> that sets up
the sets up the graphics contexts, including both the stroke and fill colors and a
<code>currentLineWidth</code> that is also new in the program:</p>

<pre>Color fill; // currentColor, possibly with alpha set to 0.4 for a translucent fill.
if (translucentFill)
    fill = Color.color(currentColor.getRed(), currentColor.getGreen(), 
                                                           currentColor.getBlue(), 0.4);
else
    fill = currentColor;
canvasGraphics.setFill(fill);  
canvasGraphics.setStroke(currentStrokeColor);
canvasGraphics.setLineWidth(currentLineWidth);
overlayGraphics.setFill(fill);
overlayGraphics.setStroke(currentStrokeColor);
overlayGraphics.setLineWidth(currentLineWidth);</pre>

<p>To control the value of the new <code>currentLineWidth</code> variable, 
I added a "Stroke Width" menu.  The commands are created and implemented
similarly to the commands in the "Color" menu:</p>

<pre>int[] lineWidths = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 10, 12, 15, 20 };
ToggleGroup lineWidthGroup = new ToggleGroup();
for (int i = 0; i &lt; lineWidths.length; i++) {
    RadioMenuItem item = new RadioMenuItem("Width = " + lineWidths[i]);
    item.setUserData(lineWidths[i]);
    item.setToggleGroup(lineWidthGroup);
    lineWidthMenu.getItems().add(item);
    if (i == 2)
        item.setSelected(true);
}
lineWidthGroup.selectedToggleProperty().addListener( e -> {
    Toggle t = lineWidthGroup.getSelectedToggle();
    if (t != null) {
        int width = (Integer)t.getUserData();
        currentLineWidth = width;
    }
});</pre>

<np>I didn't add a "Custom Stroke Width" command.  Perhaps I should have.</np>



<p>I added the two new Tools, "Stroked Filled Rect" and "Stroked Filled Oval."  They had to be added
to the <classname>Tools</classname> enum as well as to the "Tools" menu.  The basic method for drawing
shapes, <code>putCurrentShape(g)</code>, also needed cases for drawing the new tools:</p> 

<pre>case STROKED_FILLED_OVAL:
    putOval(g,true,startX, startY, currentX, currentY);
    putOval(g,false,startX, startY, currentX, currentY);
    break;
case STROKED_FILLED_RECT:
    putRect(g,true,startX, startY, currentX, currentY);
    putRect(g,false,startX, startY, currentX, currentY);
    break;</pre>
    
<np>The second parameter to <code>putOval()</code> and <code>putRect()</code> tells whether to
stroke the shape or fill it.  By calling the method twice, with the parameter equal to <code>true</code>
in one call and <code>false</code> in the other, the shape is both filled and stroked.  Adding these
two cases to <code>putCurrentShape()</code> was really the only thing necessary to draw the two
new shapes.</np>

<p>For the new "Undo" command, I used a simple one-level undo, so that the program just has
to save the most recent previous image.  I added an "Edit" menu to the program to hold
the new command.  (To avoid having just one item in that menu, I moved the three background
color commands from the "Color" menu to the new "Undo" menu.)  To implement the "Undo" command,
I needed to save the current image before modifying it in any way.  To get a copy of
the current picture in the camera, I made a "snapshot" of the canvas.  I wrote a short
method to do that, and to save the snapshot in a global variable, <code>imageForRedo</code>,
of type <classname>Image</classname>:</p>

<pre>/**
 * Save a copy of the current image for the Undo operation. This is
 * called before making any change to the image.

<np>This method must be called at every point in the code where the picture in the
canvas is about to be modified.  Of course, I didn't want to save an image unless the
picture actually was modified.  For example, in the original program, when drawing a
rect or an oval, it is possible that when the drag gesture ends, the rectangle or
oval is empty.  The original program draws the empty figure into the picture, even though
doing so doesn't actually draw anything.  In the new program, I check whether the
rect or oval is empty before drawing it; if it is empty, I don't want to
call <code>saveImageForRedo()</code>.  Similarly, in <code>doOpenImage()</code>,
I don't call <code>saveImageForRedo()</code> until I am sure that the new
image has been successfully loaded into the program.</np>

<p>The method that is called in response to
the "Undo" command draws the saved image into the display canvas.  Of course,
before doing that, it needs to save the current image in case the user wants to
"undo the undo," and the method needs to be careful to draw the old saved image
into the picture, not the new one:</p>

<pre>/**
 * Implements the "Undo" command.
 */
private void doUndo() {
    if (imageForUndo == null)
        return;
    Image previousUndoImage = imageForUndo; //Keep the current undo image.
    saveImageForUndo();  // Save image that is about to be replaced, for "undoing the undo".
    canvasGraphics.drawImage(previousUndoImage, 0, 0);  // Replace image with previous image.
}</pre>


<p>Finally, adding accelerators to menu commands is straightforward.  I added an accelerator
for every tool, as well as accelerators for the commands in the "File" menu.  The only
hard part was deciding what letters to use for all the different accelerators.</p>

<exercise>
<exercise-question><p>The sample program <sourceref chapter="11" href="PhoneDirectoryFileDemo.java"/>
from <localref href="IO.3.2"/> keeps data for a "phone directory" in a file in the user's
home directory.  <localref href="IO.ex.5"/> asked you to revise that program to
use an XML format for the data.  Both programs have a simple command-line user
interface.  For this exercise, you should provide a GUI interface for the
phone directory data.  You can base your program either on the original sample
program or on the modified XML version from the exercise.  Use a <classname>TableView</classname>
to hold the data.  The user should be able to edit all the entries in the
table.  Also, the user should be able to add and delete rows.  Include either
buttons or menu commands that can be used to perform these actions.  The
delete command should delete the selected row, if any.   New rows should be
added at the end of the table.</p>
<p>Your program should load data from the file when it starts and save data to the
file when it ends, just as the two previous programs do.  For a GUI program, you need to save the
data when the user closes the window, which ends the program. To do that, you
can add a listener to the program's <classname>Stage</classname> to handle
the WindowHidden event.  For an example of using that event, the Mandelbrot Viewer program from 
<localref href="GUI2.5"/> uses it to save preferences when the program ends.
For an example of creating an editable table, see <sourceref href="ScatterPlotTableDemo.java"/>.</p>
<p>(I suggest keeping things simple.  You not being asked to write a real phone book application!
The point is mostly to make an editable table.  My program has text input boxes for name and number, and
an "Add" button for adding a new entry containing the input in those boxes. 
My program always saves the data, whether or not the user has
changed it.   The interface will be poor:  The user has to double-click a cell to edit it and press
return to finish the edit and save the new value.  It is possible to make a
table with a better editing interface, but to do that, you need to write a new 
<classname>CellFactory</classname> class for the table.)</p>

<p>To make a table with two columns holding names and phone numbers, we need a class to represent
a row in the table.  For an editable table, the individual data values in the class should be 
stored in observable properties.  I wrote a simple nested class, <classname>PhoneEntry</classname>, for that
purpose, similar to the <classname>Point</classname> class that was used to represent rows in the
<code>ScatterPlotTableDemo</code> program:</p>

<pre>/**
 * A class that represents one phone book entry, with
 * observable properties nameProperty() and numberProperty()
 * to hold the data for the entry. (Note that the table must
 * be public and the nameProperty() and numberProperty() method
 * must be public for this class to work with an editable table.)
 */
public static class PhoneEntry {
    StringProperty name;
    StringProperty number;
    PhoneEntry(String name, String number) {
        this.name = new SimpleStringProperty(name);
        this.number = new SimpleStringProperty(number);
    }
    public StringProperty nameProperty() {
        return name;
    }
    public StringProperty numberProperty() {
        return number;
    }
}</pre>

<np>The table can then be created as a variable of type <code>TableView&lt;PhoneEntry&gt;</code>.
The data for the phone book will be stored in the list of items in the table, which is of
type <atype>ObservableList&lt;PhoneEntry&gt;</atype>.  The program use a variable,
<code>phoneEntries</code>, to refer to that list:</np>

<pre>ObservableList&lt;PhoneEntry> phoneEntries = phoneBook.getItems();</pre>

<p>The two table columns have to be created and configured.  Again, this is similar to what was
done in <code>ScatterPlotTableDemo</code>, except that in this program, the user is allowed
to sort and resize the columns  And since the values in the cells are <classname>Strings</classname>
rather than <classname>Doubles</classname>, no <classname>StringConverter</classname> is
needed for the cell factory.  The "Name" column is created as follows:</p>

<pre>TableColumn&lt;PhoneEntry, String> nameColumn = new TableColumn&lt;>("Name");
nameColumn.setCellValueFactory( new PropertyValueFactory&lt;PhoneEntry, String>("name") );
nameColumn.setCellFactory( TextFieldTableCell.forTableColumn() );
nameColumn.setPrefWidth(200);  // (Default size is too small)
phoneBook.getColumns().add(nameColumn);
nameColumn.setEditable(true);</pre>

<p>The program has "Add" and "Delete" buttons for adding and deleting phone entries.
(This part is actually modeled on <sourceref href="EditListDemo.java"/> rather than
<code>ScatterPlotListDemo</code>.)  At first, I tried just adding an empty row
when the user clicks "Add" and leaving it up to the user to fill in the name
and number in that row, but I found that it was hard even to see the empty
row in the table.  So instead, I added text input boxes for the new name and
number, and the "Add" button adds a new entry containing the data from those
input boxes.  This also allowed me to check that the two input boxes were both
non-empty before adding the entry to the table, so that I could avoid having
rows in the table where the name or number was empty.</p>

<p>For the file that stores the phone book data,
I used the simple data format from the original program.  That program already had code
for loading and saving the data, at the beginning and end of its <code>main()</code>
routine.  I copied that code into two instance methods named <code>loadPhoneBook()</code>
and <code>savePhoneBook()</code>, and I modified the code to use data stored in
an <classname>ObservableList</classname> instead of in a <classname>Map</classname>.  The <code>savePhoneBook()</code>
method is called by an event handler when the window is closed, as suggested in the exercise:</p>

<pre>stage.setOnHidden( e -> savePhoneBook(dataFile, phoneEntries) );</pre>
