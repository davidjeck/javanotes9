/**
 * A Hub is a server for a "netgame".  When a Hub is created, it will
 * listen for connection requests from clients on a specified port.
 * The clients are the players in the game.  Each player is identified
 * by an ID number that is assigned by the hub when the client connects.
 * Clients are defined by subclasses of the class netgame.commen.Client.
 * <p>A Hub is a "message center" that can send and receive messages.
 * A message can be any non-null object that implements the Serializable interface.
 * Many standard classes, including String, do this.  (So, a message might
 * simply be a string.)  When a message  is received, the protected method
 * messageReceived(sender,message) is called.  In this class, this method
 * simply wraps the message in a ForwardedMessage, which it then
 * sends to all connected clients.  That is, the Hub acts as a passive
 * forwarder of messages.  Subclasses will usually override this method
 * and will generally add other functionality to the Hub as well.
 * <p>The sendToAll(msg) method sends a message to all connected clients.
 * The sendToOne(playerID,msg) method will send the message to just the
 * client with the specified ID number.  If the same object is transmitted
 * more than once, it might be necessary to use the resetOutput() or
 * setAutoReset(true) methods.  See those methods for details.
 * <p>(Certain messages that are defined by package private classes in
 * the package netgame.common, are for internal use only.  These messages
 * do not result in a call to messageReceived, and they are not seen
 * by clients.)
 * 
 * <p>The communication protocol that is used internally goes as follows:
 *  <ul>
 *  <li>When the server receives a connection request, it expects to
 *  read a string from the client.  The string is "Hello Hub".</li>
 *  <li>The server responds by sending an object of type Integer 
 *  representing the unique ID number that has been assigned to the client.
 *  Clients are assigned the IDs 1, 2, 3, ..., in the order they connect.</li>
 *  <li>The extraHandshake() method is called.  This method does nothing
 *  in this class, but subclasses of Hub can override it to do extra setup
 *  or checking before the connection is considered to be created.
 *  Note that if extraHandshake() throws an error, then the client is
 *  never considered connected, but that client's ID will not be reused.</li>
 *  <li>All connected clients, including the one that has just connected,
 *  are notified of the new client.  (The playerConnected() method in
 *  the client will be called.)</li>
 *  <li>Once a client has successfully connected, the client can send messages to
 *  the server.  Messages received from a client are passed to the
 *  messageReceived() method.</li>
 *  <li>If the client's disconnect() method is called, the hub is notified,
 *  and it in turn notifies all connected clients, not including the one
 *  that just disconnected.  (The clients' playerDisconnected() method
 *  is called.)</li>
 *  <li>If the hub's shutDownHub() method is called, all the clients
 *  will be notified, and the ServerSocket, if any still exists, is closed down.  
 *  One second later, any connection that has not closed normally is closed.
 *  </ul>
