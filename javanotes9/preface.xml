<p><start><big>I</big>ntroduction to Programming Using Java</start> is a free
introductory computer programming textbook that uses Java as the language of
instruction.  It is suitable for use in an introductory programming course
and for people who are trying to learn programming on their own. There are
no prerequisites beyond a general familiarity with the ideas of computers and
programs.  There is more than enough material for a full year of college-level
programming.  Chapters 1 through 7 can be used as a textbook in a one-semester
college-level course or in a year-long high school course.  The remaining
chapters can be covered in a second course.</p>

<p>The Eighth Edition of the book uses Java&nbsp;8, with brief coverage
of features that were added to the language in Java&nbsp;9 and later.
JavaFX is used for GUI programming.  All sample programs and all exercise 
solutions have been compiled with Java&nbsp;11 and with Java&nbsp;16,
as well as with Java&nbsp;8.</p>
   
<p>The home web site for this book, which is always the latest version, is
<a href="http://math.hws.edu/javanotes/">http://math.hws.edu/javanotes/</a>.
The page at that address contains links for downloading a copy of
the web site and for downloading PDF versions of the book.
The web site&mdash;and the web site download&mdash;includes source code for the sample programs that are
discussed in the text, answers to end-of-chapter quizzes and a discussion
and solution for each end-of-chapter exercise.  Readers are encouraged
to download the source code for the examples and to read and run the
programs as they read the book.  Readers are also strongly encouraged
to read the exercise solutions if they want to get the most out of this book.</p>


<p>In style, this is a textbook rather than a tutorial. That is, it
concentrates on explaining concepts rather than giving step-by-step
how-to-do-it guides.
I have tried to use a conversational writing style that
might be closer to classroom lecture than to a typical textbook. This is
certainly not a Java reference book, and it is not a
comprehensive survey of all the features of Java. It is not written as
a quick introduction to Java for people who already know another programming
language. Instead, it is directed mainly towards people who are learning
programming for the first time, and it is as much about general programming
concepts as it is about Java in particular. I believe that <i>Introduction to
Programming using Java</i> is fully competitive with the conventionally
published, printed programming textbooks that are available on the market.
(Well, all right, I'll confess that I think it's better.)</p>

<p>There are several approaches to teaching Java. One approach uses
graphical user interface programming from the very beginning. And some people
believe that object oriented programming should be emphasized from the
very beginning. These are <b>not</b> the approach that I take. The approach that I favor
starts with the more basic building blocks of programming and builds from
there. After an introductory chapter,
I cover procedural programming in Chapters 2, 3, and&nbsp;4.
Object-oriented programming is introduced in Chapter&nbsp;5. Chapter&nbsp;6
covers the closely related topic of event-oriented programming and
graphical user interfaces. Arrays are introduced in Chapter&nbsp;3 with a full treatment in Chapter&nbsp;7.
Chapter&nbsp;8 is a short chapter that marks a turning point in the book, moving beyond the
fundamental ideas of programming to cover more advanced topics.
Chapter&nbsp;8 is about writing robust, correct, and efficient programs.
Chapters&nbsp;9 and 10 cover recursion and data structures, including generic programming and the Java Collection
Framework.  Chapter&nbsp;11 is about files and networking.  Chapter&nbsp;12
covers threads and parallel processing.  Finally,
Chapter&nbsp;13 returns to the topic of graphical user interface programming
to cover some of JavaFX's more advanced capabilities.</p>

<p>The biggest change from the seventh edition of this textbook is a switch from
Swing to JavaFX for GUI programming.  With just a few exceptions in code that
the user is not meant to read, all example code and exercises use JavaFX.
(Unfortunately, even as I was working on the new edition, the future of JavaFX
became unclear because, as of Java&nbsp;11, JavaFX is no longer
included as part of the basic Java download.  However, it is
still available to be downloaded and installed separately.
People who are interested in using Swing instead of JavaFX might consider
using Chapter&nbsp;6 and Chapter&nbsp;13 from Version&nbsp;7 in place of
the same chapters from Version&nbsp;8.)
The eighth edition also incorporates two features that were introduced
in Java&nbsp;8: lambda expressions and the stream API.  Lambda expressions are
covered fairly early, as part of the material on subroutines in Chapter&nbsp;4.
They are used extensively with JavaFX in Chapter&nbsp;6 and Chapter&nbsp;13, as
well as with the stream API, which is introduced in Section&nbsp;10.6.
Aside from these major changes, there are small improvements throughout,
such as a short discussion of loop invariants and class invariants in
Section&nbsp;8.2, increased coverage of Java's higher level concurrency
support in Chapter&nbsp;12, and the consistent use of factory methods like
<code>Integer.valueOf(n)</code> in preference to constructors.</p>

<p>Version 8.1 was a fairly small update to Version 8.0, and Versions 8.1.1 through 8.1.3
made only very minor changes.   The main motivation
for the update from 8.0 to 8.1 was to make it clearer how to use the book with Java&nbsp;11
and later, but I also took the opportunity to briefly discuss a few features
that were introduced after Java&nbsp;8.  The major change to the
language itself was the introduction of modules in Java&nbsp;9; these were already
mentioned in Version&nbsp;8.0, but that discussion has been updated.  (However,
this book does not explain how to create modules.)
Aside from that, there have been few language changes that impact this textbook,
but Version&nbsp;8.1 does introduce the use of var for declaring variables (Subsection 4.8.2), several new methods
related to the stream API, and the revisions made to the switch statement in Java&nbsp;14 (Subsection 3.6.5).
Version 8.1.2 added brief mentions of two additional new features in Java&nbsp;15 and &nbsp;16: 
text blocks (Subsection 2.3.5)
and records (Subsection 7.1.4).  It also updated the information about programming environments in
Section&nbsp;2.6.  Version 8.1.3 is primarily a further update of the information in Section&nbsp;2.6.</p>

<p><b>A technical note on production:</b> The on-line and PDF versions of this
book are created from a single source, which is written largely in XML. 
To produce the
PDF version, the XML is processed into a form that can be used by the TeX
typesetting program.  In addition to
XML files, the source includes DTDs, XSLT transformations, Java source code files,
image files, a TeX macro file, and a couple of scripts that are used in processing.
The scripts work on Linux and on Mac&nbsp;OS.

<p>These files were not originally meant for publication, and therefore are not very
cleanly written.  Furthermore, it requires a fair amount of expertise to use them.
However, I have had several requests for the sources and have made
them available on an "as-is" basis.  For more information about the sources and
