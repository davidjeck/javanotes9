/**
 * This demo program divides up a large computation into a fairly
 * large number of smaller tasks.  The computation is to compute
 * an image, and each task computes one row of pixels in the image.
 * The tasks are placed into a thread-safe queue.  Several "worker" 
 * threads remove tasks from the queue and carry them out.  When
 * all the tasks have completed, the worker threads terminate.
 * The number of worker threads is specified by the user.
 * (The image is a small piece of the famous Mandelbrot set,
 *  which is used just because it takes some time to compute.  
 * There is no need to understand what the image means.)
