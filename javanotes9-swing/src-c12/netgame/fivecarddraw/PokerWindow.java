/**
 * A window for one player in a two-player networked game of
 * Five Card Draw Poker.  The window is created by the main 
 * program, netgem.fivecarddraw.*.
 * <p>When a PokerWindow is opened, it establishes a
 * a connection to a PokerHub at a specified host and port.
 * Once two players have connected to the hub, the hub will
 * manage a game of poker between the two players.  Each
 * player is given $1000 to start.  One player acts a 
 * "dealer", and the dealer clicks a "DEAL" button to start
 * the game.  (The role of dealer alternates between players.)
 * After the cards are dealt, there is a first round of
 * betting.  The non-dealer player bets first.  When either
 * player matches the other's bet, the betting round ends and
 * each player has a chance to discard some cards and draw
 * new ones.  Then there is a second round of betting.  When
 * that round end, the players' hands are compared, and the
 * winner is announced.  (Players also have the choice of 
 * folding, instead of betting, which will end the game
 * immediately.)  Note that the player's amount of money
 * can become negative, and nothing is done when that
 * happens.  The game continues until one or the other
 * player quits.  The other player is notified so that
 * the second player's program can also be terminated.
 * <p>For details of the communication protocol that
 * is used between the PokerWindows and the PokerHub,
 * see the comments on the PokerHub class.
