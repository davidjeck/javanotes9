 * program must know the host name (or IP address) of the computer that
 * hosts the chat room.  When this program is run, it asks for that
 * information.  Then, it opens a window that has an input box where the
 * user can enter messages to be sent to the chat room.  The message is 
 * sent when the user presses return in the input box or when the
 * user clicks a Send button.  There is also a text area that shows 
 * a transcript of all messages from participants in the chat room.
 * <p>Participants in the chat room are represented only by ID numbers
 * that are assigned to them by the server when they connect.
