/**
 * A panel that can show a demonstration of Quicksort in action.
 * The items to be sorted are the hues of a set of vertical bars.
 * When sorted, the bars form a spectrum from red to violet.
 * Initially, the bars are sorted.  There is a Start button.  When
 * the user clicks this button, the order of the bars is randomized
 * and then Quicksort is applied.  During the sort, a black bar
 * marks the location of an empty space from which the "pivot" element
 * has been removed.  The user can abort the sort by clicking the
 * button again.
 * <p>The main point of this program is to demonstrate threads, with
 * very simple inter-thread communication.  The recursive Quicksort
 * algorithm is run in a separate thread.  The abort operation is
 * implemented by setting the value of a volatile variable that
 * is checked periodically by the thread.  When the user aborts
 * the sort before it finishes, the value of the variable changes;
 * the thread sees the change and exits.
 * <p>This class contains a main() routine that allows the demo to
 * be run as a stand-alone application.
