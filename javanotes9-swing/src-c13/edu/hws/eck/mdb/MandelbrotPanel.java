/**
 * A MandelbrotPanel contains a MandelbrotDisplay and a status bar.  The display
 * computes and displays a visualization of the Mandelbrot Set.  The status bar is
 * a JLabel that is used to display information that the user might be interested
 * in.  A mouse listener is installed on the display that enables the user to
 * zoom in and out on the image.  Nothing is done to stop the user from zooming
 * in beyond the limited accuracy of numbers of type double -- when this happens,
 * the picture will first become "blocky" and with even further zooms will become
 * meaningless.
 * 
 * <p>Mouse actions on the display:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Moving or dragging the mouse shows image coordinates corresponding to mouse location.
 * <li>Clicking the mouse zooms in on or out from a point.  If shift or meta is down when the
 * mouse was pressed, or if the right mouse button is used, then zoom out by a factor of 2;
 * otherwise, zoom in by a factor of 2.  If alt is down when the mouse is pressed, or if
 * the middle mouse button is used, then the point that was clicked is moved to the center
 * of the image; otherwise, it stays where it is and the rest of the picture moves toward
 * that point or away from it.
 * <li>Dragging the mouse will draw a box around a region of the image.  The box is forced
 * to have the same aspect ratio (shape) as the display.  The box is not drawn if it would
 * be too narrow.  If the box is there when the mouse is released, then the image is
 * zoomed.  With no modifier keys and using the left mouse button, the inside of the
 * box is zoomed to fill the entire display (this zooms in on the image, which is usually
 * what you want).  If the shift or meta key is down, or if the right mouse button is used, 
 * then the entire display is shrunk down into the box (this zooms out).
 * </ul>
