/**
 * A MandelbrotDisplay is a panel that shows a region of the xy-plane that
 * is colored to show a visualization of the Mandelbrot set.  The Mandelbrot set
 * always appears in black.  Other points are colored based on the number of
 * iterations of the Mandelbrot formula that are needed to move the point
 * to a distance of more than sqrt(4.1) units away from (0,0).  Different
 * palettes of colors can be applied to the non-Mandelbrot points.  Furthermore,
 * the length of the palette can be adjusted.  (See the setPaletteLength() command.)
 * The setLimits() method can be used to change the range of x and y values that
 * are shown in the display, but the range will always be adjusted to fit the
 * shape of the display (so that units of measure in the x and y directions are
 * the same).
 * 
 * Because the computation of an image can take quite a while, the computation is
 * done in separate threads (one thread is used for each available processor).
 * 
 * The display is also capable of drawing a "zoom box" on top of the image.  This
 * is just a box whose position and location are given by the drawZoomBox() method.
 * The applyZoom() method makes the picture zoom into or out of the current zoom box,
 * but management of the box is left to some other class (the one that calls these
 * methods.)
 * 
 * Note:  The class uses a relatively large amount of memory.  When the large data
 * structures are created, there is a small possibility that the program might not
 * have enough memory.  If this happens, the error is caught and the display will
 * show an error message instead of an image.
