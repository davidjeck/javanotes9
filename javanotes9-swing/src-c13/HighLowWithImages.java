/**
 * This program is a simple card game.  The user sees a card and
 * tries to predict whether the next card will be higher or 
 * lower.  Aces are the lowest-valued cards.  If the user makes
 * three correct predictions, the user wins.  If not, the
 * user loses.
 * 
 * This class defines a panel, but it also contains a main()
 * routine that makes it possible to run the program as a
 * stand-alone application.
 * 
 * This program depends on several additional source code files:
 * Card.java, Hand.java, and Deck.java.  It also requires the image
 * file, cards.png, which contains the images of the playing cards.
 * (The file cards.png is taken from the Gnome Desktop.)
